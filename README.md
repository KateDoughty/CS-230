Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room is a company who created a game called Draw it or Lose It! for Android. They wanted us to design a version of the game compatible with other platforms to expand their client base.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I believe I did best with determining the design constraints. Looking at what the client asked for and translating that into requirement and constraints came the easiest to me, as it was what I had the most knowledge and experience with, while the other parts required research and uncertainty.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
Having constraints in place made developing code easier, as I have a tendency to get distracted and end up falling down rabbit holes. Having a list of what was needed kept me from being distracted by anything unnecessary.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would revise the evaluation. I struggled with that section as I am not super confident in my knowledge of different platforms and languages. That section required some research to complete, and I know I only scratched the surface of what there is to know.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
The user's needs are important as they are the consumers. If a program is not user friendly or safe then no one will use it, leading to loss of revenue. Creating easy to use and secure programs is also important for a programmer's reputation, because no one wants to hire a sloppy programmer. 

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
The most dangerous thing a programmer can do is just wing it. Creating a detailed design plan and UML diagrams are the strategies I will use in the future. As someone with ADHD, it is easy for me to rush in and end up going in the wrong direction. Having plans and diagrams will help keep me on task to create a organized and efficient code.
